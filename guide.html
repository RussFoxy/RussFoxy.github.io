        <h3>Here are some recommended items to bring to practice:</h3>
          <h2>
            <b>Clothing:</b>  Spandex shorts are recommended, but any type of workout pants or gym shorts can be worn. Tight fitting top or t-shirt is recommended as well.
            <br><b>Kneepads:</b>  Kneepads are recommended to avoid bruises and floor burns, but they are not required (in fact, proper dives involve landing on your chest or stomach, not your knees). Some good brands include Mizuno and Asics. If you decide to purchase a pair, we recommend that you get a black pair since they will get dirty very easily.
            <br><b>Ankle Braces:</b> Sprained ankles are the most common type of injury in volleyball. If you have a history of sprains, we recommend you buy ankle braces (Active Ankle is the best brand).
            <br><b>Shoes:</b>  Please wear running sneakers that provide good ankle support. If you plan to play a lot, there are sneakers specifically designed for volleyball that might help your performance.
            <br><b>Jewelry:</b>  Please remove all watches, rings, and bracelets and store them in a safe place prior to playing. In addition, dangly earrings or necklaces could get in the way and pose a risk on the court.
            <br><b>Glasses:</b>  Volleyball is a contact sport, so be careful wearing glasses if you do not have prescription goggles.
            <br><b>Other:</b>  If you have long hair, make sure to pull it back into a ponytail or braid. This will help you avoid brushing up against the net by mistake.
          </h2>
          <br><br>
        <h3>Here are the basic rules:</h3>
          <h2>
            <b>Setting up the Court:</b>  In volleyball, there are six people on the court at one time for each team, or two on each side in the case of beach volleyball. Usually three people are in the front row, and three are in the back row. The front row is sectioned off by a line 10 feet from the net, called the “attack line” or the “10-foot line.” Front-row players are not confined to this section of the court, but this is where most of their playing takes place. Players rotate positions clock-wise
            <br><br>
            <b>Rotation:</b>  Positions are numbered, one through six, starting with the server in the back right corner (see graphic:  http://www.wikihow.com/Rotate-in-Volleyball) Then going in a counter-clockwise direction, the rest of the positions are numbered. The actual direction of the rotation is clockwise, however. After the server finishes, the other team gets the ball, and you get the ball back, everyone just shifts to the right one spot.
            <br><br>
            Any time a player is in the back row, he or she cannot “attack” the ball in front of the 10-foot line on the court. Attacks are also known as “hits” or “spikes”—usually the third hit of a possession. This rule is in effect to make sure that the strong hitters aren’t always able to dominate the game. When the strong hitters are in the back row, they can still attack the ball on the third hit, but they cannot jump in front of the 10-foot line.
            <br><br>
            Here is an explanation of the most common rotation strategies: "4-2", "6-2" and "5-1"

          <br><br><br>
          <b>Scoring:</b>  Volleyball uses rally serving, whereby a team scores points whenever the other team messes up. Matches are played to 25 points, but teams must win by at least two points for games to end. Points keep going until one team wins with a margin of victory of two points even if the score is greater than 25.
          <br><br>
          <b>A Few Volleyball No-No's:</b>  You cannot: <br><br>
          <ol>
            <li>Touch the net while making a play on the ball</li>
            <li>Step on the back line while serving (foot fault)</li>
            <li>Contact the ball more than three times on a side (A block doesn't count as a contact)</li>
            <li>Lift or push the ball</li>
            <li>Play the ball over the net outside of the antennas</li>
            <li>Contact the ball twice in a row (unless the first contact was a block.)</li>
          </ol><br><br>
